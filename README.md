The project is a simple compound interest calculator similar to that of Compound.finance. Compound is a decentralized, blockchain-based protocol that allows you to lend and borrow crypto and have a say in its governance with its native COMP token. 

The project is similar to compound except for the fact that the Dapp is build on the Internet protocol. The same is deployed into the ICP live blockchain using the cycles which was generated by burning the ICP tokens.

Now be careful while deploying the application as each time the application is deployed certain cycles are used, which will gradually result in detereoration of the cycles. So, I recommend you to do the changes beforehand and deploy it just once, if you are running it on the ICP(Internet Computer) blockchain. But the same can be done with using cycles on your local machine. 




install ubuntu on windows, not as a virtual machine but the "ubuntu for windows" version. install wsl and dfx on to it.
